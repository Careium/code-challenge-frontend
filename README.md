NASA’s InSight Mars lander takes continuous weather measurements (temperature, wind, pressure) on the surface of Mars at Elysium Planitia, a flat, smooth plain near Mars’ equator.
The InSight lander uses Sol - mission days - instead of normal dates.

# Requirements

- [ ] We want to pull data from the [NASA InSight Mars lander weather API](https://api.nasa.gov)
- [ ] We want to see a weekly weather overview
- [ ] For each Sol we want to see
  - [ ] Sol date
  - [ ] Earth data
  - [ ] Weather details 
- [ ] We want to see a loading indicator while waiting for data to load
- [ ] We want to be able to select a Sol start day for the weekly overview
- [ ] We want to be able to use the app on mobile as well as desktop, with mobile being the most important.

# Tech requirements
- React
- Tests (we like [Jest](https://jestjs.io))
- Linter (we like [Prettier](https://prettier.io))
- CSSinJS is a plus, but not a requirement ([JSS](https://cssinjs.org/react-jss/), [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com))


# Your challenge
- Create a React app that satisfies all the requirements listed above. If you have ideas for nice-to-have features you are welcome to add them.
- You can use any boilerplate and tools that you want to (NextJS, CRA etc) but we advice you to keep it simple. A clean, robust react app is what we're looking for, and we're usually in favor of using all available tools and tricks to get things done.
- Modern browsers, no weird legacy
- You can deploy your app on whatever cloud provider you wish (zeit, heroku, gcp etc)

# Instructions
